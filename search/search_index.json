The project configurations are stored in config/ directory. These configuration files affect your project set up and build. The application configurations are stored in src/config/ directory. These are application/business specific configurations. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you. Environment Configuration It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment where the application is running. For example, you may wish to use a different SQS queue locally than you do on your production server. To make this happen, Lesgo! uses the Serverless DOTenv plugin. DOTenv files are stored in config/environments/ directory. The supported environments are currently local , development , staging , production . These environment files can be committed to the source control. To overwrite for your local build, you may create a local DOTenv as such example: .env.development.local . This will allow you to overwrite the existing .env.development without having to commit it.

The environment files are used for both deployment and within application code. You may overwrite env files during a deployment by adding a .local suffix e.g; .env.development.local . This is useful for when you want to deploy to a specific environment but not wanting to overwrite committed values. .env : default environment, served as a local example. .env.local : local environment configuration. This should not be committed. .env.development : development environment configuration. .env.staging : staging environment configuration. .env.production : production environment configuration.","title":"Environment Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#function-config","text":"The config/functions/ directory contains the available and declared Serverless functions.","title":"Function Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#resource-config","text":"The config/resources/ directory contains the available and declared Serverless resources.","title":"Resource Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#util-config","text":"The config/utils/ directory contains additional Serverless configs where required.","title":"Util Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#the-source-directory","text":"The src/ directory contains the main source code for your application.","title":"The Source Directory"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#config-directory","text":"The src/config/ directory contains the application configurations.","title":"Config Directory"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#constant-directory","text":"The src/constants/ directory contains any application-specific constants made available throughout your source code.","title":"Constant Directory"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#core-directory","text":"The src/core/ directory contains your application's core business logic.","title":"Core Directory"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#exception-directory","text":"The src/exceptions/ directory contains error classes.","title":"Exception Directory"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#handler-directory","text":"The /src/handlers/ directory contains the entry point for all events.","title":"Handler Directory"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#middleware-directory","text":"The /src/middlewares/ directory contains the request middlewares.","title":"Middleware Directory"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#service-directory","text":"The /src/services/ directory contains class-based services or modules, usually instantiated.
