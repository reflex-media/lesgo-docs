The project configurations are stored in config/ directory. These configuration files affect your project set up and build. The application configurations are stored in src/config/ directory. These are application/business specific configurations. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you. Environment Configuration It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment where the application is running. For example, you may wish to use a different SQS queue locally than you do on your production server. To make this happen, Lesgo! uses the Serverless DOTenv plugin. DOTenv files are stored in config/environments/ directory. The supported environments are currently local , development , staging , production . These environment files can be committed to the source control. To overwrite for your local build, you may create a local DOTenv as such example: .env.development.local . This will allow you to overwrite the existing .env.development without having to commit it.
