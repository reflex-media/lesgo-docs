Quick Start \u00b6 Prerequisites Install Serverless Framework globally with: npm install -g serverless . Refer to https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/ for additional info. Create Serverless project: sls create --template-url https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo-lite/tree/master --path my-service cd my-service Install dependencies: npm install Start local: npm start Access local url via browser or Postman: http://localhost:8181/ping . Why Lesgo! Framework \u00b6 Like any other frameworks out there, we built this Framework because we couldn't find one that fits our needs. We believe that a framework for the Serverless Architecture should fit the following criteria: Super lightweight . The bundled lambda function should only bundle what is necessarily required by the function, and nothing else. This is why we chose the Serverless Framework as the basic building block for this framework. It provides the necessary tools to build, bundle, and deploy direct to AWS via CloudFormation, while still allowing the option to bundle each function individually. Easy to understand file structure . Most of our file structure, scripts, and helper functions is inspired from the Laravel Framework. The primary reason being that all the original developers and current maintainers have years of experience building applications on Taylor Otwell's Laravel Framework. If you know Laravel, you will know Lesgo! Highly adaptable for any use case . We have built multiple microservices for the last 3 years from a simple \"Unique Name Generator\", to a process-intensive \"Photo Processor\" and \"Image Moderation\", to complex projects building a Social Network App using this very same framework! Continous upgrades . As long as we continue to use this framework, we will continue to maintain and expand its functionalities. This framework will continue to grow with us. We take the learnings from our other microservices and upgrade this framework accordingly.","title":"Prologue"},{"location":"#lesgo","text":"","title":"Lesgo!"},{"location":"#a-lightweight-nodejs-boilerplate-framework-for-serverless-architecture","text":"Bootstrap your next serverless microservice with a light-weight node.js app built on top of the Serverless Framework on AWS.","title":"A lightweight node.js boilerplate framework for serverless architecture"},{"location":"#quick-start","text":"Prerequisites Install Serverless Framework globally with: npm install -g serverless .

Before you do, please read the following guidelines. Source Repositories! \u00b6 The Lesgo! source code is managed on GitHub, and live on 3 separate repositories: Lesgo! Template This is the main serverless template that developers will in their own project. Lesgo-lite! Template An even lighter template with the bare essentials of the Lesgo! Template. Lesgo! Framework Most of the core logic exists in this npm package. Lesgo! Documentation Repository for this documentation. Submission context \u00b6 Got a question or problem? \u00b6 Submit an issue to our Github Repository and we'll try our best to follow-up. Found a bug? \u00b6 If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our Github Repository . Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines. Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our Github Repository . If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone, as the Lesgo! framework is highly opinionated. Please consider what kind of change it is: For a major feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master, as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the overall functionality of the theme. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template. Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead. Development : Fork the project, set up the development environment, make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits. Pull Request : Commit your changes, push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to lesgo:develop. If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR. After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Interested in contributing to the Lesgo! framework?

You may also simply update the respective environment files in config/environments/* as such: # AWS Secret Manager ARN to allow app db user connect to the specified db DB_SECRET_ARN = \"\" # AWS Secret Manager ARN to allow app command db user connect to the specified db # for running \"command\" like functions like database schema migration DB_SECRET_COMMAND_ARN = \"\" # AWS Secret Manager ARN for the Aurora Serverless database cluster DB_RESOURCE_ARN = \"\" # Database name to connect to DB_NAME = \"\" Basic Queries \u00b6 To run a basic query, you may use the query method on the Utils/db : import db from \"Utils/db\" ; const data = await db . query ( \"SELECT * FROM users\" ); /** [ { id: 1, username: 'John Doe', }, { id: 2, username: 'Jane Doe', }, ... ] */ Warning While it is OK to write raw queries with values inserted directly in the query statement, note that this is risky. Use prepared statement as show below as much as possible. Using Prepared Statement \u00b6 You should always use prepared statement for your queries. import db from \"Utils/db\" ; const data = db . query ( \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id LIMIT 1\" , { id : 1 , }); /** [ { id: 1, username: 'John Doe', }, { id: 2, username: 'Jane Doe', }, ... ] */ Available methods \u00b6 The Utils/db also comes with more specific and granular methods for specific queries.

Configuration \u00b6 There are 2 levels of configurations for the Lesgo! framework. The project (serverless) configurations are stored in config/ directory as .yml files. These configuration files affect your project set up and build. The application configurations are stored in src/config/ directory as .js files (We'll move to TypeScript soon, we promise!). These are application/business specific configurations. Each configuration is documented below, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options relevant to you. Environment Configuration \u00b6 It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment where the application is running. For example, you may wish to use a different SQS queue locally than you do on your production server. To make this happen, Lesgo! uses the Serverless DOTenv plugin. DOTenv files are stored in config/environments/ directory. The supported environments are currently local , dev , sandbox , prod . These environment files can be committed to the source control. To overwrite for your local build, you may create a local DOTenv as such example: .env.dev.local . This will allow you to overwrite the existing .env.dev without having to commit it.

This should not be committed. .env.dev : development environment configuration. .env.sandbox : sandbox environment configuration. .env.prod : production environment configuration.","title":"Environment Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#function-config","text":"The config/functions/ directory contains the available and declared Serverless functions.","title":"Function Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#resource-config","text":"The config/resources/ directory contains the available and declared Serverless resources.","title":"Resource Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#util-config","text":"The config/utils/ directory contains additional Serverless configs where required.","title":"Util Config"},{"location":"getting-started/structure/#the-documents-directory","text":"The documents/ directory contains any documents outside of the application.
