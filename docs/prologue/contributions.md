# Contribution Guide

To encourage active collaboration, we encourage and accept Pull Requests. The Lesgo! source code is managed on GitHub, and there are repositories for each of the Lesgo! projects:

- [Lesgo Application](https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo)
- [Lesgo Documentation](https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo-docs)
- [Lesgo Framework](https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo-framework)

Pull Requests should be submitted to the next available `release/` branch. If none exists, submit to the `develop` branch instead.
