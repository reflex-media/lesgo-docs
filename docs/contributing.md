## Submission context

### Got a question or problem?
Submit an issue to our [Github Repository](https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo/issues) and we'll try our best to follow-up.

### Found a bug?
If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our [Github Repository](https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines.

### Missing a feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [Github Repository](https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo/issues). If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone, as the Lesgo! framework is highly opinionated. Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a major feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master, as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the overall functionality of the theme.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue
Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template.

Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead.

1. **Development**: Fork the project, set up the development environment, make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits.
2. **Pull Request**: Commit your changes, push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to lesgo:develop. If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR.

After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.
